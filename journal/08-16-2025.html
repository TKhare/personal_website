Didn't have much time to work today. Got back from SF late last night, then today went to my cousins house for Rakhi, then played some pickle, had Janmanshtami, and hung out with the homies

Spent a bit more time with transformer math, including finishing the "illustrated transformer" article. Again, notes <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HBdClydi9yagHKQcUlLzjf9EMJDC2lgI9AGhp9uP7A0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>
